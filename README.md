# Description

Built this todos app for the terminal using JavaScript. It's basically designed to allow users to add, read, update and delete todos using commands in the terminal. The todos are stored in a Postgres database. This was week 8's weekend assessment at the Teach2Give boot camp and and was a follow up to learning DBMS.
